# Project Euler

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

During my free time I like to attempt to solve a lot of these problems from Project Euler and have decided to upload some of my favorite completed projects. But, out of respect for what this website and its creators stand for, I have made all of my completed projects private.

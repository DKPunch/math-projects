# Math Projects

During my downtime, in between school semesters, I like to search for projects to mess around with in order to keep my brain fresh. I eventually stumbled across a website that posts complicated mathematical problems that can be solved with a combination of mathematical  knowledge and programming skills. I would like to post a few of my favorite problems that I have solved from this website, but I will not mention the site and I will try to be discrete with any projects that I upload, to avoid popping up on the GitHub search engine for anyone looking for quick answers. This is simply out of respect for what the creators of the site stands for, and I hope they keep publishing these abstract problems for the programming puzzle-seekers out there.
